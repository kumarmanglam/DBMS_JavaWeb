1. **Create a table of Employees with indexing based on salary:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Create an index on the salary column
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON Employees (salary);
```

This SQL code creates a table named `Employees` with columns `emp_id`, `emp_name`, and `salary`. It then creates an index named `idx_salary` on the `salary` column to improve the performance of queries involving salary-based operations.

2. **Create a stored procedure to find the average of the top 5 employees' salaries:**

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE AvgTop5Salaries()
BEGIN
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM (
        SELECT salary
        FROM Employees
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 5
    ) AS top_5_salaries;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

This stored procedure named `AvgTop5Salaries` retrieves the top 5 salaries from the `Employees` table and calculates the average salary among them.

3. **Denormalization:**
   Denormalization is the process of ==intentionally adding redundancy to a database design to improve read performance== at the expense of increased data duplication and storage requirements. It involves storing redundant data or precalculating derived data to simplify and speed up read operations.

4. **Transaction Management:**
   Transaction management refers to the process of ensuring the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of database transactions. It involves ==controlling the execution of multiple database operations as a single unit of work==, ensuring that either all operations succeed or none of them do.

   Example:
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;

   -- Update salary of employee with ID 1001
   UPDATE Employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE emp_id = 1001;

   -- Deduct bonus from salary of employee with ID 1002
   UPDATE Employees SET salary = salary - 5000 WHERE emp_id = 1002;

   -- Commit the transaction if all operations succeed
   COMMIT;
   ```

   In this example, we begin a transaction, execute multiple SQL statements to update employee salaries, and then commit the transaction if all updates are successful. If any update fails, the transaction can be rolled back to maintain data consistency.

5. **Pagination in SQL:**
   Pagination is the process of dividing large result sets into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. It allows users to view data in increments rather than all at once, improving performance and usability.

   Here's an example query to paginate data in SQL (assuming `offset` and `limit` parameters for pagination):

   ```sql
   -- Pagination query
   SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
   FROM Employees
   ORDER BY salary ASC
   LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
   ```

   In this query, `LIMIT` specifies the maximum number of rows to return, and `OFFSET` specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows. By adjusting the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` values, you can navigate through different pages of data.


### JDBC Imp Coding Questions

1. **What is JDBC?**
   - JDBC stands for ==Java Database Connectivity==. It is an API (Application Programming Interface) provided by Java for connecting and interacting with relational databases from Java programs. JDBC enables Java applications to execute SQL queries, retrieve and update database data, and perform other database-related operations.

2. **What is JDBC Driver? What is DriverManager? What is ResultSet?**
   - **JDBC Driver:** A JDBC driver is a software component that ==allows Java applications to interact with a specific database management system== (DBMS). It implements the JDBC API to provide connectivity between Java applications and databases. JDBC drivers are available in different types, such as JDBC-ODBC bridge, type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4 drivers.
   - **DriverManager:** DriverManager is a class in the JDBC API that manages the JDBC drivers. ==It is responsible for loading the appropriate JDBC driver based on the database URL provided by the application==, establishing database connections, and managing connections pools.
   - **ResultSet:** ==ResultSet is an interface in the JDBC API that represents the result set of a database query==. It ==provides methods for navigating through the rows of the result set, retrieving data from the columns, and performing other operations on the query results==.

3. **How to connect to MySQL using JDBC. Give config syntax (java config and xml)**
   - **Java Configuration:**
     ```java
     import java.sql.Connection;
     import java.sql.DriverManager;
     import java.sql.SQLException;

     public class MySQLJDBCExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // JDBC URL, username, and password
             String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
             String user = "username";
             String password = "password";

             try {
                 // Get a connection to the database
                 Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
                 System.out.println("Connected to the database");

                 // Perform database operations...

                 // Close the connection
                 connection.close();
             } catch (SQLException e) {
                 System.out.println("Connection failed. Error: " + e.getMessage());
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **XML Configuration (DataSource):**
     ```xml
     <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:jdbc.properties" />

     <bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource">
         <property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}" />
         <property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}" />
         <property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}" />
         <property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}" />
     </bean>
     ```

4. **Perform CRUD operation using JDBC.**
   - Here's a brief example demonstrating CRUD operations using JDBC:
     ```java
     // Assuming 'connection' is a valid JDBC connection object
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
     // Create operation
     PreparedStatement insertStatement = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (?, ?)");
     insertStatement.setInt(1, 101);
     insertStatement.setString(2, "John Doe");
     insertStatement.executeUpdate();

     // Read operation
     Statement selectStatement = connection.createStatement();
     ResultSet resultSet = selectStatement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM employees");
     while (resultSet.next()) {
         int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
         String name = resultSet.getString("name");
         System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
     }

     // Update operation
     PreparedStatement updateStatement = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE employees SET name = ? WHERE id = ?");
     updateStatement.setString(1, "Jane Smith");
     updateStatement.setInt(2, 101);
     updateStatement.executeUpdate();

     // Delete operation
     PreparedStatement deleteStatement = connection.prepareStatement("DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = ?");
     deleteStatement.setInt(1, 101);
     deleteStatement.executeUpdate();
     ```

5. **Explain the difference between execute(), executeQuery(), and executeUpdate() methods in JDBC.**
   - `execute()`: This method can be used to ==execute any SQL statement (DDL, DML, or DCL).== It returns a boolean value indicating whether the first result is a ResultSet. It is suitable for executing statements that may return multiple results, such as executing stored procedures.
   - `executeQuery()`: This method is specifically used to ==execute SELECT queries== that retrieve data from the database. It returns a ResultSet containing the query results.
   - `executeUpdate()`: This method is used to ==execute DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE==, etc., that modify the database data. It returns an integer value representing the number of rows affected by the statement.

6. **What is JDBC Connection? Explain steps to get JDBC database connection in a simple Java program.**
   - JDBC Connection represents a connection to a specific database. ==It is obtained using DriverManager class== in Java.
   - Steps to get JDBC database connection:
     1. ==Load the JDBC driver class using `Class.forName()` (if necessary==).
     2. Obtain a ==connection to the database using `DriverManager.getConnection==()`.
     3. Use the obtained connection to execute SQL queries, perform database operations, etc.
     4. Close the connection using `Connection.close()` when done.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Load the JDBC driver (optional for JDBC 4.0+)
     Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

     // JDBC URL, username, and password
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
     String user = "username";
     String password = "password";

     // Get a connection to the database
     Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

     // Use the connection for database operations...

     // Close the connection when done
     connection.close();
     ```

7. **Explain the methods available for Transaction Management in JDBC.**
   - Transaction management in JDBC can be done using the following methods:
     - `setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit)`: This method is used to enable or disable auto-commit mode for the connection. When auto-commit mode is disabled (`autoCommit` set to false), changes made within the transaction are not automatically committed to the database. You need to explicitly call `commit()` or `rollback()` to complete or cancel the transaction, respectively.
     - `commit()`: This method is used to commit the changes made within the transaction to the database. It makes the changes permanent.
     - `rollback()`: This method is used to cancel the changes made within the transaction and revert the database to its state before the transaction started. It discards the changes.
   
These methods allow you to control transaction boundaries and ensure data integrity when working with databases in JDBC.
